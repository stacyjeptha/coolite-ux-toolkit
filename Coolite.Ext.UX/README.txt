   PLEASE NOTE: EACH EXTENSION MAY HAVE UNIQUE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS.
/************************************************************************/

UX extensions are contributed by the community and it is up to the
copyright holder to determine the license they wish their code and 
resources (.js, .css, images and documentation) to be distributed under. 

Each extension (or plugin) is contained within a dedicated project sub
folder. For example, the SlidingPager plugin is stored within the 
/Plugins/SlidingPager/ folder.

Each folder contains all files necessary to build and deploy that 
particular UX extension. 

In the root of each UX folder must be both a LICENSE.txt and README.txt
file. The LICENSE.txt file must contain either a copy of the license
or a url pointing to the location where ther license can be found. 

For example, the SlidingPager plugin was created by ExtJS LLC and the
plugin is provided under the same dual license (GPL or Commercial) terms 
as the main ExtJS JavaScript license. If you have a Coolite Professional 
Edition license, you may use the ExtJS authored extension under the terms 
of the Coolite Professional License. 

If you do not have a Coolite Professional License, then the ExtJS authored
extension is available to use under the terms of the Coolite Community 
License (GPL). 
 
Techincal and licensing support is provided in the Coolite Community 
Forums or provided as noted in the README.txt by the original UX author.
